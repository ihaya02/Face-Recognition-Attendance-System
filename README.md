Face Recognition Attendance System

This project is a simple system that automatically records attendance using face recognition.

The system works by detecting faces through a camera and comparing them with saved images. When a face is recognized, the person is marked as present automatically.

The attendance is saved in an Excel file with the date and time.

Tools used in this project include Python, OpenCV, and PyQt5.

The purpose of this project is to reduce manual attendance recording and demonstrate basic face recognition concepts.
